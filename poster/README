This generates a Periodic Table of X-ray absorption edges and emission lines
using data from Elam, Ravel, and Sieber, Radiation Physics and Chemistry 63 (2002)
and a latex source file heavily derived from the periodic tables of the elememts
by Ivan Griffin in the tikZ example set
    http://texample.net/tikz/examples/periodic-table-of-chemical-elements/

to generate a large format PDF Periodic Table, use

   make

The Elam, et al data is held in the database file xrayref.db.  The scripy gen_atoms.py
uses this (and the xraydb.py file) to extract the data and write out latex paragraphs
for each element.  That is, the file atoms.tex is generated with

   python gen_atoms.py > atoms.tex

while the PDF is generated with

   pdflatex ptable_xray
